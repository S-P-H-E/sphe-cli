Adding project flags with -p

**Reason:**
The point of this CLI is to quickly scaffold projects. Whether for
production or for testing and I needed a quick way to select my project
type, intialise git and install dependecies and using commander.js to add a `-p` or `--project` flag helped signifciantly as I can now skip the options selection process.
